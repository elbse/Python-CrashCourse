🧩 Lesson 2: Control Flow in Python

Python uses indentation (tabs/spaces) instead of {} for code blocks.
👉 Usually 4 spaces per indent.

🔹 1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult!")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")


➡ No parentheses needed (though allowed).
➡ Indentation defines scope — no curly braces!

🧠 Quick Note:

Comparisons work as expected:

==  # equal
!=  # not equal
<, <=, >, >=


And logical operators:

and, or, not

🔹 2. Example: Even or Odd Checker
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd")

🔹 3. Loops — for and while
👉 for loop

Python’s for loop iterates over any sequence (list, string, etc.)

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


Output:

0
1
2
3
4


You can specify a start and step:

for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)


→ prints odd numbers from 1 to 9

🧩 How range(start, stop, step) Works

The range() function generates a sequence of numbers using three parameters:

range(start, stop, step)


start → where to begin (inclusive)

stop → where to end (exclusive → it stops before this number)

step → how much to increment each time

⚙️ Applying to range(1, 10, 2)
Parameter	Meaning	Value
start	Start counting from	1
stop	Stop before	10
step	Add this amount each loop	2

So Python counts like this:

Start at 1
Next = 1 + 2 → 3
Next = 3 + 2 → 5
Next = 5 + 2 → 7
Next = 7 + 2 → 9
Next = 9 + 2 → 11 → stop (because 11 ≥ 10)


✅ Output:

1
3
5
7
9

👉 while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1


Be careful — if you forget to update count, it loops forever 😅

🔹 4. Loop Control Statements
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break       # stop the loop
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue    # skip even numbers
    print(i)

🔹 5. Nested Loops and Conditionals

You can nest conditionals and loops easily:

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

Grading System
Ask the user for a score (0–100) and print:

A (90–100)
B (80–89)
C (70–79)
D (60–69)
F (below 60)


Sum of Numbers
Use a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N,
where N is input from the user.

Countdown Timer
Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1, then print “Blast off 🚀!”
