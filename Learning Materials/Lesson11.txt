🧠 Lesson 11: Error Handling & Custom Exceptions

🎯 Goal:

Make your program bulletproof — no crashes when users make mistakes.
Instead, your app should respond gracefully, with clear error messages.

🔍 What Are Exceptions?

An exception is an error that stops your program from running.
For example:

age = int(input("Enter age: "))


If you type "hello", Python crashes with:

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10


We’ll fix that using try/except.

🧩 Basic Try/Except Example
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    print("You are", age, "years old.")
except ValueError:
    print("❌ Please enter a valid number.")


✅ No more crashing — the user just gets a friendly message.

🔁 Multiple Exceptions

You can handle multiple types of errors:

try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
    print(result)
except ValueError:
    print("❌ Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("❌ You can’t divide by zero.")

🔄 The finally Block

finally runs no matter what — perfect for cleanup tasks (like closing files).

try:
    f = open("test.txt", "r")
    data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("❌ File not found.")
finally:
    f.close()

🧩 Using try/except in Your Bank System

Here’s how to protect deposit and withdraw inputs:

elif user_choice == "1":  # Deposit
    try:
        amount = float(input("Enter deposit amount: "))
        acc.deposit(amount)
    except ValueError:
        print("❌ Please enter a valid numeric amount.")


and:

elif user_choice == "2":  # Withdraw
    try:
        amount = float(input("Enter withdrawal amount: "))
        acc.withdraw(amount)
    except ValueError:
        print("❌ Invalid input. Enter a valid number.")

💡 Bonus: Create Custom Exceptions

You can make your own error types for better clarity.

Example:

class InsufficientFundsError(Exception):
    pass

class InvalidAmountError(Exception):
    pass


Then use them:

def withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount <= 0:
        raise InvalidAmountError("Withdrawal must be positive.")
    elif amount > self.__balance:
        raise InsufficientFundsError("Not enough funds.")
    else:
        self.__balance -= amount
        print(f"✅ Withdrew ₱{amount:.2f}")


And catch them:

try:
    acc.withdraw(10000)
except InsufficientFundsError as e:
    print(f"❌ {e}")

Concept	Description
try/except	Catches errors gracefully
finally	Runs cleanup code
Custom Exceptions	Define app-specific error types
