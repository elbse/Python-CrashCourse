ðŸ§© Lesson 1: Python Basics & Syntax
ðŸ”¹ 1. Your First Python Program

In Python, you donâ€™t need to define types or use semicolons.

print("Hello, World!")


Thatâ€™s it â€” no public static void main. ðŸ˜„

Run this in:

VS Code terminal, or

Online at https://replit.com
 or https://python.org/shell

ðŸ”¹ 2. Variables and Data Types

Python automatically infers types:

name = "Alice"        # string
age = 22              # integer
height = 5.7          # float
is_student = True     # boolean

print(name, age, height, is_student)


You can check a variableâ€™s type using:

print(type(age))

ðŸ”¹ 3. Basic Operations
x = 10
y = 3

print(x + y)   # addition
print(x - y)   # subtraction
print(x * y)   # multiplication
print(x / y)   # float division
print(x // y)  # integer division
print(x % y)   # remainder
print(x ** y)  # exponent (10Â³ = 1000)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Strings and f-Strings
name = "Alice"
age = 22

print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")  # modern and clean

ðŸ”¹ 5. Getting Input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")


(In online IDEs, input() may prompt below the console.)

ðŸ’ª Quick Exercise (Your Turn!)

Try to write a short script that:

Asks the user for their name and birth year.

Calculates their age (assuming the current year is 2025).

Prints:

Hello Alice, you are 20 years old.
