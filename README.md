# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository!** 🎓  
This repo documents my personal journey learning **Python**, from the fundamentals to advanced topics and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  

I’m using this space to track my progress, take notes, and commit code examples as I explore how Python powers **automation**, **data science**, **web apps**, and more.

---

## 🎯 My Goals

- Master Python’s **core syntax** and **data structures**  
- Understand how to write clean, efficient, and Pythonic code  
- Learn **functions**, **OOP**, and **error handling**  
- Explore **advanced features** like decorators and generators  
- Build **mini-projects** to apply what I learn  
- Document my journey clearly for future reference  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Setup

- **Python 3.10+**
- **VS Code** (with Python extension)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Virtual Environments** (`venv`)
- **Git + GitHub** for version control
- **Command Line / Terminal**
